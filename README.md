# M351_project
This project focuses on the application of numerical methods for temperature prediction using interpolation and extrapolation techniques. The primary objective is to predict temperature values based on a set of discrete data points. Interpolation is achieved through the Lagrange interpolation method, which constructs a polynomial that passes through all given data points. This method is effective in estimating temperatures for known time intervals. For extrapolation beyond the known data range, the least squares method is employed, fitting a cubic polynomial to the data and using it to predict temperature values outside the observed range.The project investigates the impact of using cubic polynomials for extrapolation, and considers potential improvements such as regularization and alternative models like linear regression for more reliable predictions. The results demonstrate the challenges and limitations of extrapolation when using cubic polynomials and provide insight into improving prediction accuracy.
